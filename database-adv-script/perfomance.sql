-- QUERY PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION - AIRBNB DATABASE
-- Objective: Refactor complex queries to improve performance
-- ====================================================================

-- 1. INITIAL COMPLEX QUERY (BEFORE OPTIMIZATION)
-- Retrieves all bookings with user, property, and payment details

SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    b.created_at AS booking_created,
    
    -- User details
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.phone_number,
    u.role,
    
    -- Property details  
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.description AS property_description,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    p.created_at AS property_created,
    
    -- Host details
    host.user_id AS host_id,
    host.first_name AS host_first_name,
    host.last_name AS host_last_name,
    host.email AS host_email,
    
    -- Payment details
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount AS payment_amount,
    pay.payment_method,
    pay.payment_date,
    
    -- Review details (if exists)
    r.review_id,
    r.rating,
    r.comment AS review_comment,
    
    -- Additional calculated fields
    DATEDIFF(b.end_date, b.start_date) AS nights_stayed,
    (b.total_price / NULLIF(DATEDIFF(b.end_date, b.start_date), 0)) AS effective_nightly_rate
    
FROM Booking b
-- Join with User (guest)
INNER JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
-- Join with Property
INNER JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
-- Join with User again for host details
INNER JOIN User host ON p.host_id = host.user_id
-- Left join with Payment (not all bookings have payments)
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
-- Left join with Review (not all bookings have reviews)
LEFT JOIN Review r ON b.property_id = r.property_id AND b.user_id = r.user_id

ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;

-- ====================================================================

-- 2. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS USING EXPLAIN

-- Analyze the initial query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    pay.amount AS payment_amount
FROM Booking b
INNER JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
INNER JOIN User host ON p.host_id = host.user_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
LEFT JOIN Review r ON b.property_id = r.property_id AND b.user_id = r.user_id
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;

/*
EXPECTED PERFORMANCE ISSUES:

1. UNNECESSARY JOIN: Review table join creates Cartesian product for multiple reviews
2. REDUNDANT DATA: Host details join might not be needed in all scenarios  
3. COMPLEX CALCULATIONS: DATEDIFF and calculations in SELECT
4. NO FILTERING: Retrieving all historical data
5. MULTIPLE INDEX SCANS: Could benefit from covering indexes

-- 3. REFACTORED OPTIMIZED QUERIES

-- OPTIMIZED VERSION 1: Core booking data with essential joins only
SELECT

    p.pricepernight,
    
    -- Essential payment details only
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount AS payment_amount,
    pay.payment_method
    
FROM Booking b
-- Use LEFT JOIN for User in case we want to see orphaned bookings
LEFT JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
-- Use LEFT JOIN for Property for data consistency
LEFT JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
-- LEFT JOIN for Payment (only for confirmed bookings typically)
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id

-- Add meaningful filters to reduce result set
WHERE b.created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)  -- Last year only
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;

-- ====================================================================

-- OPTIMIZED VERSION 2: Separate queries for different use cases

-- Query for booking management dashboard (minimal data)
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location
FROM Booking b
INNER JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.status IN ('confirmed', 'pending')
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC
LIMIT 100;  -- Pagination for UI

-- ====================================================================

-- OPTIMIZED VERSION 3: Use CTEs for better readability and performance
WITH booking_summary AS (

        booking_id,
        property_id,
        user_id,

),
payment_summary AS (

-- ====================================================================

-- OPTIMIZED VERSION 4: Application-level pagination with indexed columns
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,

    p.location
FROM Booking b
INNER JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.created_at < ?  -- Pagination cursor
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;  -- Fixed page size

-- ====================================================================

-- 4. TARGETED OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

-- STRATEGY 1: Create covering indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_dashboard ON Booking(created_at DESC, status, user_id, property_id)
INCLUDE (start_date, end_date, total_price);

CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_recent ON Booking(user_id, created_at DESC)
INCLUDE (property_id, start_date, end_date, total_price, status);

-- STRATEGY 2: Add filtered indexes for active data
CREATE INDEX idx_active_bookings ON Booking(created_at DESC) 
WHERE status IN ('confirmed', 'pending');

-- STRATEGY 3: Materialized view for frequently accessed summary data
-- (Note: Syntax varies by database)
/*
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW booking_summary_view AS
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR);

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
    -- Original complex query
    SELECT b.booking_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, p.name, pay.amount
    FROM Booking b
    INNER JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id

    SELECT b.booking_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, p.name, pay.amount
    FROM Booking b

-- 6. APPLICATION-LEVEL OPTIMIZATIONS

-- Use application logic to reduce database load:

-- 1. LAZY LOADING: Load basic booking info first, then load details on demand
-- 2. CACHING: Cache frequently accessed booking data
-- 3. PAGINATION: Implement server-side pagination
-- 4. DATA DENORMALIZATION: Consider storing frequently accessed fields together

-- Example: Two-step data loading
-- Step 1: Get booking IDs and basic info
SELECT booking_id, start_date, end_date, status, user_id, property_id
FROM Booking 
WHERE user_id = ? 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- Step 2: Get detailed info for specific bookings only when needed
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.amount AS payment_amount
FROM Booking b
LEFT JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE b.booking_id IN (?, ?, ?);  -- Specific IDs only

-- ====================================================================
-- PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY:
--
-- BEFORE OPTIMIZATION:
-- - Multiple unnecessary joins
-- - No result set limiting
-- - Complex calculations in SELECT
-- - Cartesian products from redundant joins
-- - Full table scans
--
-- AFTER OPTIMIZATION:
-- - Reduced joins to essential only
-- - Added meaningful WHERE clauses
-- - Implemented pagination
-- - Used covering indexes
-- - Moved calculations to application layer
-- - Used CTEs for complex logic
--
-- EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT: 60-80% faster execution
-- REDUCED MEMORY USAGE: 50-70% less
-- BETTER SCALABILITY: Handles larger datasets efficiently
