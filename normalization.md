Normalization Review and 3NF Explanation üìùObjectiveThe current database schema (User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, Message) will be reviewed to confirm it meets the rules for 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.1. First Normal Form (1NF)Rule: Eliminate repeating groups and ensure all attributes hold atomic (single) values.Review: All attributes (e.g., first_name, pricepernight, start_date) are single-valued, and no tables contain repeating column groups.Conclusion: The schema meets 1NF.2. Second Normal Form (2NF)Rule: Must be in 1NF, and all non-key attributes must be fully dependent on the entire primary key. This is only relevant for tables with a composite primary key.Review: None of the current tables have a composite primary key. The User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, and Message tables all use a single-column UUID as their primary key.Conclusion: The schema meets 2NF by design.3. Third Normal Form (3NF)Rule: Must be in 2NF, and there should be no transitive dependencies. That is, non-key attributes must not be dependent on other non-key attributes.Review of Potential Transitive Dependencies:TablePotential Violation?JustificationUserNoAttributes like first_name and email directly describe the user_id.PropertyNoAttributes like name and location directly describe the property_id. The host_id is an FK, which is acceptable.BookingNostart_date, end_date, and total_price are properties of the booking_id.PaymentNoamount and payment_method are properties of the payment_id linked to a booking_id.ReviewNorating and comment describe the specific review_id linked to the property/user.MessageNomessage_body describes the message_id.Recommendation for Strict 3NF/BCNF:While the current design is solid, for maximum adherence to normalization principles, especially if the attribute definitions become complex, one could consider extracting ENUM-like attributes into their own lookup tables. This is often done for scalability, data integrity (easier modification/addition of values), and to meet a very strict definition of 3NF/BCNF, where the value of a string (like 'credit_card') shouldn't depend only on the primary key, but on the descriptive name itself.Extract Roles: Create a Role_Type table.Table: Role_Type (role_type_id PK, name UNIQUE)Change: Replace User.role (ENUM) with User.role_type_id (FK to Role_Type).Extract Statuses: Create a Booking_Status table.Table: Booking_Status (status_id PK, name UNIQUE)Change: Replace Booking.status (ENUM) with Booking.status_id (FK to Booking_Status).Extract Payment Methods: Create a Payment_Method table.Table: Payment_Method (method_id PK, name UNIQUE)Change: Replace Payment.payment_method (ENUM) with Payment.method_id (FK to Payment_Method).ConclusionThe original schema already meets the technical requirements for 3NF. The suggested adjustments (creating lookup tables for ENUMs) are best practice for enterprise databases (denoting a higher level of normalization, often approaching BCNF) but are not strictly required to correct a transitive dependency violation in the current structure.No changes are required to the table structure to achieve 3NF based on the provided attributes. The design is efficient and well-structured.
